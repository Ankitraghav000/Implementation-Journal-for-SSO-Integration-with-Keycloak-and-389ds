# Approach Paper for SSO Setup with Keycloak and 389ds

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the approach for implementing a Single Sign-On (SSO) solution using Keycloak and 389 Directory Server (389ds). The integration aims to provide seamless access to multiple services, including Grafana, GitLab, and MinIO, through a single login process.

## 2. Objectives

- **Seamless User Experience**: Enable users to access Grafana, GitLab, and MinIO with a single set of credentials.
- **Centralized Authentication**: Utilize Keycloak as the central identity provider for managing user identities and access control.
- **Enhanced Security**: Implement OAuth2 and OpenID Connect protocols to secure user authentication and authorization.

## 3. Components Involved

- **Keycloak**: An open-source identity and access management tool that provides SSO capabilities.
- **389 Directory Server (389ds)**: An LDAP server for managing user identities and authentication.
- **Grafana**: A data visualization and monitoring tool.
- **GitLab**: A web-based DevOps lifecycle tool that provides a Git repository manager.
- **MinIO**: A high-performance, distributed object storage system.
- **OAuth2 Proxy**: A reverse proxy that provides authentication for web applications.

## 4. Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Linux operating system administration.
- Access to a Linux environment for software installation and configuration.
- Basic knowledge of Docker.
- Administrative access to the LDAP server for integration with Keycloak.

## 5. Implementation Steps

### 5.1 Keycloak Configuration

- **Install Keycloak**: Follow the installation steps to set up Keycloak on the base system.
- **Create a Realm**: Set up a realm in Keycloak for managing users and clients.
- **Configure Clients**: Register Grafana, GitLab, and MinIO as clients in Keycloak to enable authentication.

### 5.2 Grafana Integration

- **Install Grafana**: Deploy Grafana using Podman or Docker.
- **Configure Grafana**: Set Grafana to use Keycloak as its authentication provider by enabling OAuth2 or OpenID Connect.

### 5.3 MinIO Integration

- **Install MinIO**: Deploy MinIO using Podman or Docker.
- **Configure MinIO**: Set MinIO to use Keycloak for authentication, ensuring secure access to storage.

### 5.4 GitLab Integration

- **Install GitLab**: Deploy GitLab using Podman or Docker.
- **Configure GitLab**: Integrate GitLab with Keycloak for user authentication.

### 5.5 OAuth2 Proxy Setup

- **Install OAuth2 Proxy**: Download and configure OAuth2 Proxy to handle authentication requests.
- **Configure Nginx**: Set up Nginx as a reverse proxy for Grafana, MinIO, GitLab, and OAuth2 Proxy.

### 5.6 389ds Setup

- **Install 389ds**: Deploy 389 Directory Server using Podman.
- **Configure LDAP**: Set up the LDAP structure and add users for authentication.

## 6. Testing and Validation

- **Access Services**: Test the SSO functionality by accessing Grafana, GitLab, and MinIO using Keycloak credentials.
- **Verify User Authentication**: Ensure that users can log in once and access all services without re-entering credentials.

## 7. Conclusion

The implementation of SSO using Keycloak and 389ds will enhance user experience by providing seamless access to multiple services with a single login. This approach not only simplifies user management but also strengthens security through centralized authentication.

## 8. Future Work

- **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement monitoring solutions to track authentication requests and user activity.
- **User  Management**: Explore advanced user management features in Keycloak for role-based access control.
